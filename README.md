# Contact Organizer Backend

This is the backend for my small contact organizer application.

## Prerequisites

You need to have `docker`, `docker compose` and `postgres` installed.

## Run locally

When running it the first time you need to create the database manually: 

First you need to start a database with

```
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
```

Then connect to it via

```
psql -U postgres -h localhost postgres
```

Create a database named `cms` with 
```aidl
Create database cms;
```

After that you need to make sure that you also have the needed [frontend repository](https://github.com/JetteBke/contact-organizer-for-fun) cloned.
For both, this one and the frontend repo you need to build the docker images with
```aidl
docker build -t <THE_IMAGE_NAME_YOU_SELECT>:<THE_VERSION_TAG_YOU_WANT> .
```

Make sure to put the correct image names in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of this repository.

Run `docker compose up` in the root directory. (This should now start the database, frontend and backend and you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`)

Whenever you are done, just run `docker compose down` to stop the different services.
